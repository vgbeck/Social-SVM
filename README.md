The purpose of this ML model is to predict the emotions (positive/negative) associated with comments from social media. I chose which features to apply and at what weights, what performance metrics to judge by, and seperated the training vs testing data to refine my model. I experimented with Accuracy, F1-Score, AUROC, Precision, Sensitivity, and Specificity performance metrics. My final model focused on accuracy with a quadratic SVM and a sigmoid kernel. I used stemming and lemmitization as part of the feature engineering to clean my data sets. I also tried this with one v one and one v rest classifiers before settling on one v one.
